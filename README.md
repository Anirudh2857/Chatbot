This chatbot was built using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Please note that it only works on Tensorflow 1.0.0.

**Data Preprocessing**

In the data preprocessing step, we first create a dictionary to map each line to its respective ID. We then create a list of all the conversations and separate out all the questions and answers. Next, we clean the questions and answers so that it will be easier during training. For example, "I'm" will be changed to "I am" and so on. We also remove the words in which the occurrences are less than 5%, which is done by having a certain threshold value. Then we add tokens to the dictionaries.

**Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) Model**

The next step is building the Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) model. Seq2Seq models are mainly used in tasks such as translation. In the RNN, we use a concept called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), which can not only process single data points but also process sequences of data. We create an encoding and decoding layer in this type of model.

**Usage**

To use the chatbot, run the train.py script. This will train the model and save it as a checkpoint. Then run the chat.py script to interact with the chatbot. The chatbot will ask for an input text, and it will generate a response based on the training data.
